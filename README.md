# Madame Oracle: Front End

Welcome to the Madame Oracle Front End repository! This front-end application is part of a MERN stack project that incorporates AI, speech-to-text, an AI model, and text-to-speech playback. The project is designed to provide an intuitive and engaging user experience.

## Functionality
- **User Interface:** We have designed a sleek and responsive user interface to provide users with an engaging and visually appealing experience.
- **Interactive Elements:** The front end includes dynamic components that facilitate efficient user interaction.

## Technologies
- **React:** We used React, a powerful JavaScript library, to build the user interface with reusable components.
- **React Router:** React Router was utilized to manage navigation and rendering of components for different routes.

## Microphone Interaction
To interact with the Madame Oracle AI model, you can use the "click and hold" microphone feature. Here's how it works:

1. **Activate the Microphone:** Click the microphone button to activate it. This step grants access to the microphone for communication with Madame Oracle.

2. **Click and Hold to Talk:** Once the microphone is activated, click and hold the microphone button to start talking to Madame Oracle. Keep the button held down while speaking.

3. **Release to Stop Talking:** When you're done speaking, release the mouse button. Madame Oracle will process your speech, and you'll receive a response.
